# Fall-detection-system-for-elderly-people

Abstract:

Fall detection is a major challenge in the public healthcare domain. Falls for the elderly can
be especially serious, as they can lead to serious health issues. Making a system to alert when
a fall occurs is helpful, as it provides peace of mind to both the wearer and their loved ones.
Nowadays, fall detectors are commonly included in smartwatches, wearable fitness trackers,
and other types of wearables. Fall detection can also be done by a surveillance camera, also
known as a computer-vision-based fall detection system. There are several kinds of fall
detection methods and the algorithm each uses is what makes them unique and accurate.
